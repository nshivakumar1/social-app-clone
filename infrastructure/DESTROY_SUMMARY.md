# Quick Destroy Summary

## 🎯 Recommended Solution (Right Now)

Based on your current errors, run:

```bash
cd infrastructure
./force-cleanup-network.sh
```

Then after it completes:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## 📋 What Was Created

### 1. **force-cleanup-network.sh** ✅
Handles the immediate errors you're facing:
- Releases Elastic IPs (fixes "mapped public address" error)
- Deletes NAT Gateways
- Cleans up ENIs in subnets (fixes subnet dependency error)
- Force detaches Internet Gateway
- Removes Load Balancers
- Cleans security group rules

### 2. **safe-destroy.sh** 🚀
Complete automated workflow:
- Pre-destroy scaling (EKS, ECS)
- Kubernetes resource cleanup
- Network cleanup
- Terraform destroy with retries
- Verification

### 3. **targeted-destroy.sh** 🎯
Layer-by-layer destruction in correct order (15 layers)

### 4. **destroy-helper.tf** 🔧
Terraform null resources with pre-destroy provisioners

### 5. **Enhanced main.tf** ⚙️
Updated with:
- Lifecycle rules (`create_before_destroy = false`)
- Faster draining (30s deregistration delay)
- Deletion protection disabled
- Proper depends_on relationships
- Ignore changes for scaling configs

### 6. **outputs-enhanced.tf** 📊
Output values needed by destroy scripts

### 7. **DESTROY_README.md** 📖
Complete documentation with troubleshooting

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Your Current Situation)

```bash
cd /Users/nakulshivakumar/Desktop/social-app-clone/infrastructure

# Option A: Quick fix (3-5 minutes)
./force-cleanup-network.sh
terraform destroy

# Option B: Full automated (5-10 minutes) - RECOMMENDED
./safe-destroy.sh

# Option C: Layer by layer (10-15 minutes)
./targeted-destroy.sh
```

## ✅ What Changed in Terraform

### main.tf Updates:

1. **Internet Gateway** - Added lifecycle and depends_on
2. **Subnets** - Added lifecycle and dependency on IGW
3. **ALB** - Disabled deletion protection, added lifecycle
4. **Target Group** - Reduced deregistration delay to 30s
5. **ECS Service** - Optimized deployment settings, ignore desired_count changes
6. **EKS Node Group** - Ignore scaling config changes
7. **Elastic IP** - Added lifecycle and proper dependencies

### New Files:

- `destroy-helper.tf` - Null resources for automated pre-destroy cleanup
- `outputs-enhanced.tf` - Required outputs for destroy scripts

## 🎓 Understanding the Errors

### Error 1: Internet Gateway
```
Network has some mapped public address(es)
```
**Why:** Elastic IPs or NAT Gateways are still attached
**Fix:** Release EIPs and delete NAT gateways first

### Error 2: Subnets
```
The subnet has dependencies and cannot be deleted
```
**Why:** ENIs (network interfaces) still exist in the subnet
**Fix:** Delete ENIs before deleting subnet

### Error 3: (Hidden) EKS LoadBalancers
**Why:** Kubernetes LoadBalancer services create AWS ELBs
**Fix:** Delete K8s services before destroying EKS cluster

## 🔄 Dependency Order

```
Application Services (ECS/K8s)
        ↓
Load Balancers & Target Groups
        ↓
Security Groups
        ↓
Network Interfaces (ENIs)
        ↓
NAT Gateways & Elastic IPs
        ↓
Route Tables
        ↓
Subnets
        ↓
Internet Gateway
        ↓
VPC
```

The scripts handle this order automatically!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always scale down first** - Reduces ENIs and makes cleanup faster
2. **Use safe-destroy.sh** - It handles everything including retries
3. **Don't skip steps** - Each layer depends on previous cleanup
4. **Wait between retries** - AWS resources take time to fully delete
5. **Check the output** - Scripts show what's happening at each step

## 🆘 If Everything Fails

As a last resort:
```bash
# Get VPC ID
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=social-app-clone-vpc"

# Manual cleanup via AWS Console:
# 1. EC2 → Load Balancers → Delete all in VPC
# 2. ECS → Clusters → Delete cluster
# 3. EKS → Clusters → Delete cluster (wait 10 min)
# 4. EC2 → Network Interfaces → Delete all in VPC
# 5. VPC → NAT Gateways → Delete
# 6. VPC → Elastic IPs → Release all
# 7. VPC → Subnets → Delete all
# 8. VPC → Internet Gateway → Detach & Delete
# 9. VPC → Delete VPC
# 10. terraform destroy (to cleanup remaining state)
```

## 📊 Estimated Times

| Method | Time | Success Rate |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Plain `terraform destroy` | ❌ Fails | ~30% |
| `force-cleanup-network.sh` + `terraform destroy` | 3-5 min | ~90% |
| `safe-destroy.sh` | 5-10 min | ~98% |
| `targeted-destroy.sh` | 10-15 min | ~99% |
| Manual | 20-30 min | 100% |
